# Analysis_US_Colleges - Using GLM and Logistic Regression

A dataset related to the details of the US Colleges from the 1995 issue of US News and World Report was analyzed and EDA and descriptive summary statistics were generated to find some useful insights about the college data. The selection of the college can be very crucial for the students based on many factors like private/public university, graduation rate, college expenses, faculties holding a PhD/Terminal degree. Both private and public universities have their own set of pros and cons and the analysis of this dataset can be useful in understanding about private/public university colleges from various perspectives. Generalized linear model (GLM) functions were used with logistic regression to build a model to predict whether a university is private or public. A confusion matrix was generated to study the accuracy of the model, and other metrics like recall, precision, specificity, sensitivity were interpreted from the results. An ROC curve was plotted and AUC (Area Under Curve) was calculated to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the model.
